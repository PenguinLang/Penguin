    <h1 align="center">Penguin: A Programming Language for Kids</h1>
    <p align="center">Penguin is a programming language created specifically to promote coding among kids. Its sole purpose is to make coding easy and accessible for children. This language is designed to be easy to read, with a syntax that closely resembles English. Penguin has very basic functionality, allowing beginners to develop basic logic and get familiar with coding, making it easy for them to switch to other programming languages in the future.</p>
